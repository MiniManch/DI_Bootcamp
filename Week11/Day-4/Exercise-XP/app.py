# This database contains a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains these keys:

# ProductId, Category, MainCategory,TaxTarifCode, SupplierName, WeightMeasure
# WeightUnit, Description, Name, ProductPicUrl, Status, Quantity, UoM, CurrencyCode
# Price, Width, Depth, Height, DimUnit
# We will be using these keys to represent each item in our marketplace.
# You donâ€™t have to use all the keys.

# Build a marketplace website, the website should have 3 pages:
# A homepage, with a welcome message, routed to /.
# A products page, that displays a list of all the products that are for sale, routed to /products.
# A product details page, that displays the details of the selected product 
# (the product id should be passed into the URL), routed to /product/<product_id>
